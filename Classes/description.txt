[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I think I refused this mod in the beginning because I thought it would only be a simple copy of the Ripped Goat... But someone asked for it again recently and I thought that I could pack into this mod a bunch of abilities that were requested by many people but that I could never add to another mod ^^
So the main feature here is the ability to kill NPCs forever (I took that from my Wizard Goat mod). Of course as a One Punch Goat you need a super strong headbut and kick so I tried to make it so that it will be strong but not too much (to avoid having objects catapulted out of the map in less than one second :p).
Then I added a few other abilities that are usefull in general and not too hard to implement: the immunity to ragdoll in most cases is already present in the game (used for the T-Rex mutator), and the huge sprint speed is something you can change easily ^^
Also as I didn't want any flight ability in this mod (because it's not really matching the character), I still added a super high jump that work very well with the anti-ragdoll ability :)[/quote]
